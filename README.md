# ING Project 
Project created as part of cooperation with ING 

## Description:
Main task of this app is to fetch post from [JsonPlaceholderAPI](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), moreover gives you functionality like typical forum app like Reddit but simplified. More options and functionality will be added in time.

## Problems: 
API is not perfect because requests for specific comments are a little slow what cause some timeouts when requesting from time to time - **this can be probably can be repaired with saving data in database to now request it every time we load the app.**
</br>
I do not really know if the architecture and project is not a little bit too over complexified - **there are some way for improvements like adding dependency injection and maybe changing the architecture to MVVM**

## Possible upgrades: 
1. Searching for specific post, user or comment
2. Filtering posts
3. Showing all users in the API
4. Adding user profile picture in User Fragment
